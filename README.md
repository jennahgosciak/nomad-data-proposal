# Code Repository for the Nomad Data Challenge

Notebooks use synthetic mobility data for NYC based on [`synthetic_philadelphia.py`](https://github.com/Watts-Lab/nomad/blob/7c1abb3298e1754d730412b3148b7486f83069c5/examples/research/virtual_philadelphia/synthetic_philadelphia.py)

* [00_descriptive_analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/jennahgosciak/nomad-data-proposal/blob/main/00_descriptive_analysis.ipynb): loads auxiliary data and computes overall descriptive statistics
* [01_synthetic_mobility_visualization.ipynb](https://github.com/jennahgosciak/nomad-data-proposal/blob/main/01_synthetic_mobility_visualization.ipynb): simple visualization of synthetic mobility data
* [03_time_series_health_outcomes.ipynb](https://github.com/jennahgosciak/nomad-data-proposal/blob/main/03_time_series_health_outcomes.ipynb): time series plots of health-related outcome data
